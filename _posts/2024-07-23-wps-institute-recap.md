The WPS Institute, located in Newton Centre, Massachusetts, is a dynamic nonprofit organization dedicated to redefining education through student-centered learning, leadership development, and experiential opportunities. Founded in 2017, WPS aims to create a more inclusive and innovative approach to education that extends beyond traditional classroom settings. The institute’s focus is to provide students with tools, mentorship, and real-world experiences to foster their growth as leaders, thinkers, and community change-makers.

At its core, the WPS Institute seeks to empower young people by giving them the ability to shape their educational journeys. Their approach emphasizes flexibility, student agency, and collaboration between students, educators, and community partners. WPS envisions a world where learning can happen everywhere — not just in school — and where education is personalized to meet the unique needs and interests of each student.

The organization serves as a hub for educational experimentation, working closely with schools, universities, families, and community groups to co-create new models of learning. They provide support in areas like program design, professional development for teachers, and research on best practices for fostering creativity and innovation among students.

One of the key offerings at the WPS Institute is its Summer Leadership Institute (SLI), a three-week intensive program designed for rising high school sophomores, juniors, and seniors. The program is crafted to develop leadership skills, entrepreneurial thinking, and hands-on problem-solving in areas like biotechnology, engineering, and social innovation. Students work directly with mentors and experts from institutions like MIT and local community organizations, gaining exposure to cutting-edge research and practices. This immersive program encourages participants to explore urban spaces, network with professionals, and take ownership of their personal and professional development.

Beyond the SLI, WPS also offers a unique Innovation Everywhere Internship for selected students. This internship provides participants with stipends to work on community impact projects throughout the school year, either individually or in small cohorts. It emphasizes student-driven ideas and problem-solving, allowing students to apply the skills they learned during the summer program to real-world challenges.

In 2023, WPS opened the Community Learning Lab on their Newton campus. The lab partners with local out-of-school organizations to offer tailored, innovative programming for middle and high school students. The goal is to co-create learning experiences that are relevant to the students’ lives, fostering creativity, choice, and empowerment. These partnerships also allow the institute to develop resources that can be shared with schools and community organizations across the Greater Boston area.

WPS’s efforts in the lab are part of a broader effort to reimagine the way middle and high school education is delivered. They aim to move beyond the classroom walls and create a more experiential, engaging, and student-focused approach to education.

Collaboration is at the heart of WPS’s model. The institute works with universities, such as Harvard and MIT, as well as local organizations to research and develop best practices for out-of-school learning. By partnering with these institutions, WPS ensures that their programs are grounded in the latest educational research and are designed to provide students with meaningful, hands-on learning experiences.

The institute is also a part of the Community Innovation Partnership, which aims to redesign middle school education to be more experiential and relevant. This initiative involves working directly with local schools, families, and community members to identify ways to make education more engaging for students and to prepare them for future leadership roles.

WPS is continually expanding its offerings and impact across the region. With a strong commitment to educational equity, the organization strives to make its programs accessible to students from all backgrounds. They offer full and partial scholarships for many of their programs, ensuring that financial constraints do not prevent students from participating.

Looking ahead, WPS plans to continue growing its network of partnerships and programs, exploring new ways to empower students and create transformative learning experiences. As the organization evolves, its focus remains on cultivating a new generation of leaders who are equipped to address the challenges of tomorrow.

The WPS Institute in Newton is a beacon of educational innovation, committed to transforming how students experience and engage with learning. Through its wide array of programs, partnerships, and research initiatives, WPS empowers students to take control of their educational journeys, fostering skills that are essential for success in the modern world. By reimagining education to be more flexible, inclusive, and relevant, WPS is not just preparing students for the future — it’s helping to shape it.
