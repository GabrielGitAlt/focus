**Panel:**

**Q: Gloria, what inspired you to become a lawyer?**
A: Knew wanted to help people, along the way people encouraged her to apply to be a judge, fortunate to be appointed by governor and now able to help young people.

**Q: What inspired you to be a part of public service?**
A: First wanted to be a nurse, and felt it would be a good way to give back to the community. Was a nurse for a while then moved to Newton and became involved with the Newton democratic city committee.

**Q: Gloria what does a typical day look like for you as a judge?**
A: It really depends on who got arrested the night before and is at court. See a lot of civil cases where parents have had their kids removed from them by the state.

**Q: For both: Do you offer internships or shadowing opportunities?**
A: Love to see young people come into their offices. Pretty active and busy, love to have interns help sort things out, in her office has interns do a drafting office to help them write their own piece of legislation. In summers there is a legislation program for young people who come in to see judges, governor, speaker of the house, and legislatures. The way to do it is to find out who represents you, and talk to them about internship opportunities.

**Q: Gloria, how did your education and early career help you?**
A: In high school didn't think she would end up where she is now. Especially in college and law school, decided her major based on what she was interested in.

**Q: Gloria, in your work what unique challenges have you faced as a woman and person of color in your field?**
A: Remember sitting in a busy courtroom and being the only Asian American in the whole courthouse. Was waiting to see if any new cases were coming in for her, and the judge stopped and asked if she needed help. Thought she was the interpreter. Had been mistaken for everyone except a judge, people couldn’t believe there could be a woman judge. Was the first Asian American judge in the juvenile court, governor made priority to diversify the court, still the only one in her court.

**Q: How can students make their voices heard on issues they care about even if they can't vote yet?**
A: Need to register to vote, can't vote yet but you will be able to, and time goes by fast. If registered to vote, you are more likely to read the newspapers and know what is going on. A way to learn more is to intern, or can contact your state legislature. Much more diversity now, and more women too.

**Q&A for everyone in crowd**

**Q: When you become a judge do you need to apply, or do they just choose from who stands out?**
A: Governor has about 20 judicial nominees, long application, pretty extensive/intense application. They go through and decide who they want to interview, then take a vote to see if they want to pass you to the next stage. Reputation is very important no matter what field. Will call people you reference and people you don’t. Get passed on to the governor's attorney, they will interview you and give recommendation to governor, then governor will decide. Governor interviews you and then you can get sworn in. Public hearing where they interview you (confirmation). Very long process.

**Q: As the first Asian American judge in MA's juvenile court, how do you make difficult decisions?**
A: Difficult to make decisions, and if there are conditions where she thinks it would be safe, she would rather have the child with their parents than locked up in jail. Also has to think about the community because the decision will affect them as well, especially if there is a victim. Certain things you learn over time, especially with more experience.

**Q: What was the process like going from a nurse to a state representative?**
A: Seemed like it would be a nice thing to try out. With her healthcare background she thought she would have a lot to offer to the legislature. A lot of her legislatures are about healthcare. Had a good sense of families and children and what their needs are, can make laws that are helpful.

When people get arrested, it stays on record forever. Easier for juveniles because they are more protected, but much harder as an adult. Expungement is really hard because of law, but now legislatures are thinking about these things.
